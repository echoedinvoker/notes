* Running RBook Locally
*
You can run RBook locally on your computer if you wish.  This is 100% optional.

The upside to this is that your notebooks will be saved on your computer, which means backing them up is a lot easier.

To run RBook locally, you must have NodeJS installed.  If you don't already have it, get an installer here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

  Then, at your terminal run 
  @code
  npx rbook
  @end
  and navigate to 
  @url
  http://localhost:3050
  @end

Any notebook you create will be saved into the same folder that you ran npx rbook in.



Again, this is 100% optional, you can complete the entire course using {https://rbook.cloud}
