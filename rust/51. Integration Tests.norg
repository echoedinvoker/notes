* Integration test

  Compared to unit tests, integration tests test multiple functions, mainly to check if the interaction between functions is working properly.

  integration tests are placed in the 'tests' folder at the top level of the project. RUST will compile each file on top level in the 'tests' folder as an independent test crate.

* Helpers fn of integrated test

  Sometimes the content of the integrated test is very complicated, so we may want to extract some codes and create helper functions.

  In the above attempt, because helpers.rs is at the top level of the 'tests' folder, its file is compiled into a test crate, which is not what we want.

  So we create a module 'helper' and refactor using the above method, with the aim of not having the file at the top level, so that when using `cargo test`, helpers will be compiled as a test crate.
