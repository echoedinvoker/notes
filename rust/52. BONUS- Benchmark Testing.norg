* What is benchmarking test & prepare two algorithms to do the same task

  Benchmarking test is mainly used to test different implementations of the same task or different versions of the same implementation to see which one performs better.

  The performance of benchmarking tests can be divided into three types: process time, memory usage, and disk usage. Here, the main focus here is on testing process time.

* Install criterion and setup

  Although RUST itself has benchmarking test functionality, it is still unstable. Using criterion would be more convenient.
