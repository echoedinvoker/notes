* Only test library

  If there are binary and library, we can just test the library.

* Show fn output in test report

  The output of the tested function fn will not be displayed in the test report.

  But if needed, we can use `--show-output` to display the output of fn.

* Filter fn

  We can use the name of the test fn to filter the test fn to be executed as follows.

** full fn name

** partial fn name

* Ignored test fn

  Sometimes some tests are too huge to run together with other tests. We use #\[ignore\] to ignore these tests in regular testing.

** \#\[ignore\]

** run ignored test fn
   We can use `-- --ignored` to only run those ignored test functions.
