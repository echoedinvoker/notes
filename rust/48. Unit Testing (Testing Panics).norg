* Test function which should return panic

** simple panic
   We add `#[should panic]` to test functions that should trigger a panic.

** panic with specific message
   Sometimes we want to test a specific panic instead of all panics. We can use `#[should panic(expected = "message")]` to specify the message of that panic.

* Some features of test function

** independent
   The test function can exist independently and does not need to be inside mod tests (but conventionally it is done this way).

** become helper function without #\[test\]
   A `[#test]` is required to be a test function in order to generate a report, otherwise it will be a helper function.

** test function can access private functions
   However, private methods in the struct still cannot be directly accessed.
