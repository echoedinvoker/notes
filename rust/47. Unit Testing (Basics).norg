* Create test project and running test

** test result

The test function can obtain test results in two ways:

* Assertion macro

   Usually, when panic occurs, the program will terminate, but `cargo test` will only produce a FAILED result and continue running other tests.

* Result enum

  \? after the function that returns a Result, if an Err is returned, it will early return and terminate the program. If an Ok is returned, it will continue executing.
