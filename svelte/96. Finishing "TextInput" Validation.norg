* Not show invalid styles at first

  We should only display the validation error message after the user has inputted for a certain period of time, for example, after the user has filled in the field and left (blurred) it.

  We establish a state 'touched' to represent the state mentioned above, and use event 'blur' to trigger it.

* Finish other fields

  We will demonstrate using the email field below.

  So each field may require a different validation function, and there can be multiple validations applied to the same field.
