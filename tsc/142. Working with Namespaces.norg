* Create namespace file and refer it

** create namespace file

   "namespace" is a syntax exclusive to TypeScript that allows packaging related code together, not limit to interface, it can also be used for class, function, variable, etc.

** refer to it

   The way of importing a namespace file is completely different from the usual import. It must be done using the `/// <reference path="xxx.ts" />` method, and the original codes must also be enclosed in a namespace with the same name in order to work properly.

** test

   work as expected ðŸ˜„


* Refer multiple namespace files

** build/refer 2nd namespace
   We establish another namespace TS file according to the above process and reference it using the tag 'reference' in the same way.

** error reason
   In short, the reference tag is not importing a script but pointing to a JS file. Due to this logic limitation, the same file can only point to a single JS file at the same time. If it points to two different JS files, an error will occur as mentioned above.

* Solve compile error

** try to solve it
   Because it is pointing to two JS files causing an error, we changed the configuration of tsconfig to make the compiled file only generate one JS file.

   Still have error...

** QA solution
   Finally, the answer was found during the course QA.
