* Setup developement server

** package.json
   The script `webpack-dev-server` will run a development server with hot reloading, but you need to configure the parameters of devServer in webpack.config.js, along with some other settings.

** store compiled codes in memory
   The development server will store the compiled codes in memory, so it does not actually generate a dist folder, nor does it require bundle.js inside it.
