* Demand: build a reusable validation pattern

The validation condition cannot be used repeatedly in the if-condition as shown below, so we need to establish a pattern that can be reused.

* Validatable object

* validation function

* Replace if condition with validation function & Validatable object

  The above approach of verification is very easy to reuse and easy to read, which is a good design pattern.
