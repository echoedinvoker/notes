> In this lecture, we are going to refactor the view as a resource, using the route and controller approach.


* Create sub-app for views

  The view router we built is like a sub-app. We moved the codes we previously made into it, and then included this sub-app into the app.


* Move callbacks to controller

  Then move the callback function in the routes to the controller.

  Let's make sure that all work as before on the browser.

* Modify a bit by different requirement

  Here we modify the logic of the route based on the requirement. '/' should render overview.pug instead of parent.

* Concern about routes blocking

  According to past experience, the route check path is from top to bottom and not particularly smart. Placing '/' in front of other API routes has caused concerns about falling into the API routes.

  Actually test the API routes with a browser to see if they still work.

  There is still a function, it seems that Express is smart enough ðŸ˜„
